# GenAI-Manipulate
Making Human-Robot Interaction Effortless through the use of a Generative AI. This is a ROS2 based project that combines computer vision and generative AI to detect and classify objects, enabling intuitive human-robot interaction. This system interprets user requests and needs and determines appropriate robotic actions to assist.
