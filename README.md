## About

**GenAI Manipulation** is a ROS 2-based project that combines computer vision and generative AI to enable intuitive human-robot interaction. By detecting and classifying objects, the system interprets user requests and determines appropriate robotic actions to assist in various tasks. The goal is to make human-robot interaction effortless by leveraging advanced AI techniques to understand and fulfill user needs.
